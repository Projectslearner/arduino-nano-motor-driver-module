# Motor Driver Module

#### Project Overview

The Motor Driver Module project demonstrates how to control a DC motor using an Arduino Nano and a motor driver module. The motor can be rotated clockwise and counterclockwise, with the ability to stop the motor in between rotations.

#### Components Needed

1. **Arduino Nano**
2. **Motor Driver Module**
3. **DC Motor**
4. **Power Supply (Battery or Adapter)**
5. **Jumper Wires**

#### Block Diagram


#### Circuit Setup

1. **Connect Motor Driver Module to Arduino Nano:**
   - Connect the IN1 pin of the motor driver module to a digital pin (e.g., pin 2) on the Arduino Nano.
   - Connect the IN2 pin of the motor driver module to another digital pin (e.g., pin 3) on the Arduino Nano.
   - Connect the motor terminals to the motor output terminals of the motor driver module.
   - Connect a power supply (battery or adapter) to the motor driver module to power the motor.

#### Instructions

1. **Circuit Setup:**
   - Wire the motor driver module and DC motor to the Arduino Nano as described in the circuit setup section.

2. **Power Supply:**
   - Ensure the power supply connected to the motor driver module is appropriate for the motor's voltage and current requirements.

3. **Code Upload:**
   - Connect the Arduino Nano to your computer via USB.
   - Open the Arduino IDE and paste the provided code.
   - Upload the code to the Arduino Nano.

4. **Testing:**
   - Once the code is uploaded, observe the behavior of the DC motor.
   - Monitor the Serial Monitor for printed messages indicating motor rotation direction.
   - Verify that the motor rotates clockwise, stops, rotates counterclockwise, and stops again as programmed.

#### Applications

- **Robotics:** Control motors in robotic projects for locomotion or manipulation tasks.
- **Automotive:** Implement motor control systems for vehicle applications such as windshield wipers or power windows.
- **Industrial Automation:** Use motor driver modules to control conveyor belts, pumps, or actuators in industrial settings.

#### Notes

- Ensure the motor driver module can handle the voltage and current requirements of the DC motor.
- Adjust the delays in the code to modify the duration of motor rotation and stop periods.
- Experiment with different motor driver modules and DC motors to match the project requirements.
